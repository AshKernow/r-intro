```{r cache=TRUE}
genes <- read.delim("gene.description.txt")
subjects <- read.delim("cancer.patients.txt")
evals <- read.delim("gene.expression.txt",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

`r ncol(evals)` patients were involved in this study.

```{r}
evals <- evals[,match(subjects$samplename,colnames(evals))]
```

```{r}
ind <- match("ESR1", genes[,2])
probe <- genes[ind,1]
```

```{r}
genevals <- evals[match(probe,rownames(evals)),]
```

`r table(subjects$er)[1]` patients were ER Negative, and `r table(subjects$er)[2]` patients were ER positive

```{r echo=FALSE}
boxplot(as.numeric(genevals)~factor(subjects$er),main="Expression of ESR1 in ER negative and positive")
```

```{r results='hide'}
res<- t.test(as.numeric(genevals)~factor(subjects$er))
```

The p-value of the association between ESR1 and ER status is `r res$p.value`
